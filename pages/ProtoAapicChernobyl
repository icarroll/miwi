### English translation of original warning

Attention, Attention!

Due to the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the city of Pripyat, adverse radioactive conditions are forming.

To ensure the radiation safety of the people, and children in particular, there appears a necessity to conduct a temporary evacuation of the residents of the city to the nearby towns of the Kiev region.

For this reason, today, on April 27, starting from 2 PM, buses will arrive to each house.

They will be accompanied by police and representatives of city administration.

It is recommended to take documents, items of absolute necessity, and also food for an initial time.

Comrades! When temporarily leaving your apartments, please do not forget to close windows, shut off electric and gas appliances, and to turn off water taps.

Please stay calm and organized during the temporary evacuation.
