### Language family history.

ProtoAapic is the language of the initial migrants to the great western river valley and inland sea areas. The migrants came from upriver to the east, having traveled from the eastern basin across the continental divide.

ProtoAapic has developed into a spectrum, with neighboring dialects being mutually intelligible. The topology is roughly Y-shaped, with one branch along the great river valley, and the other two branches along the north and south shores of the inland sea. Curiously enough, on the western shore of the sea, the north and south branches meet, but at that point are no longer mutually intelligible. However, the villages there are able to communicate via blessing jar script (unsure about story language, need to decide).

### Plans for daughter languages.

There are three major dialect groups:

* RiverAapic
* NorthAapic
* SouthAapic

With CentralAapic existing at the mouth of the great river, being a median between the three dialect continua.

There is also a dialect forming from the western shore contact between extreme varieties of North and South Aapic, but as the contact is fairly recent (first contact within living memory), it has yet to become established.
